        &emsp; Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. 
        The boy was called <big> Hansel and the girl Gretel </big>. He had little to bite and to break, 
        and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily 
        bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his 
        anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: <em>What is to become of us? </em> How are we to 
        feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves? I'll tell
        you what, husband, answered the woman, early tomorrow morning we will take the 
        children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a 
        fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go 
        to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we 
        shall be rid of them. No, wife, said the man, I will not do that; how can I bear
         to leave my children alone in the forest?—the wild animals would soon come and
          tear them to pieces. O, you fool! said she, then we must all four die of hunger, 
          you may as well plane the planks for our coffins, and she left him no peace 
          until he consented. But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,
        said the man.
    </p>

        &emsp; The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what 
        their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to 
        Hansel: Now all is over with us. Be quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress 
        yourself, I will soon find a way to help us. And when the old folks had fallen 
        asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside.
        The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house 
        glittered like real silver pennies.
